Synthetic ECG Generator using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
This project is a deep learning model capable of generating realistic, synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals of normal human heartbeats. It was developed to address the critical challenges of data privacy and scarcity in the medical AI field, providing a tool to create high-quality, anonymous data for research and development.

Final output: 10 unique, synthetic heartbeats generated by the trained model.

üí° The Core Problem: A "Crash Test Dummy" for Heart AI
In the world of medical AI, data is everything. To train an algorithm that can save lives by detecting a heart condition, you need thousands of examples. However, real patient data is highly sensitive and protected by strict privacy laws, making it difficult to access and share.

This project tackles that problem head-on. The goal was to build a "digital crash test dummy" for the human heart. Just as car manufacturers use dummies to safely test their vehicles, this GAN can be used to generate a limitless supply of realistic ECG data. This allows researchers and engineers to safely and ethically test, validate, and improve their life-saving algorithms without ever needing to touch real patient information.

ü§ñ How It Works: An AI "Art Forger" vs. an AI "Art Critic"
The technology at the heart of this project is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It works by setting up a competition between two neural networks:

The Generator (The Art Forger üé®): This network's job is to create fake ECGs. It starts by taking a random vector of noise and tries to transform it into a signal that looks like a real heartbeat.

The Discriminator (The Art Critic üßê): This network is an expert at telling the difference between a real ECG (from our dataset) and a fake one created by the Generator.

The two networks are trained in a constant "battle." The Generator gets better at making fakes, and the Discriminator gets better at spotting them. After thousands of rounds of training, the Generator becomes so skilled that its creations are nearly indistinguishable from reality.

üöÄ How to Run This Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your own machine.

1. Setup the Environment
First, clone the repository and set up a Python virtual environment.

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ECG-GAN-Generator.git
cd ECG-GAN-Generator

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv ecg_env
source ecg_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `ecg_env\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required libraries
pip install tensorflow wfdb numpy matplotlib

2. Prepare the Data
Run the prepare_data.py script. This will automatically download the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, process all the recordings, extract the normal heartbeats, and save them into a single file for training.

python prepare_data.py

This step can take 10-15 minutes.

3. Train the GAN
Run the train_gan.py script to start the training process. The script includes a checkpointing system, so you can safely stop and resume the training at any time.

python train_gan.py

This is a long process and can take 2-3 days on a standard CPU. As it trains, it will save image samples to the training_output/ folder and checkpoints to the training_checkpoints/ folder.

4. Generate Final Results
Once the training is complete, run the generate_final_ecg.py script to use your trained model to create and display a final set of synthetic ECGs.

python generate_final_ecg.py

This will save a final_generated_ecgs.png file in the root directory.

üîÆ Future Work
The success of this project serves as a foundation for a more advanced system: a Conditional GAN (cGAN). The next step is to modify this architecture to generate specific types of heart arrhythmias on demand, creating a precision tool for targeted medical research.
